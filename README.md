# Weather Application

The purpose of this project is to develop a weather application that provides weather forecasts using a RESTful web service. Users have the ability to query the weather forecast for a particular city. Estimates are provided at 3-hour intervals covering a 5-day period. The application receives weather forecast data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
